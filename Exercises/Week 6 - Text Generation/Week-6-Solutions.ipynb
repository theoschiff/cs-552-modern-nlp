        "### Motivation\n",
        "In this section, we will take a close look on how to evaluate generated text. In translation or other sequence-to-sequence tasks, we do not have a single way to get a *correct* answer. For example, consider a model that outputs the text:\n",
        "\n",
        "> The cat is fluffly.\n",
        "\n",
        "and the correct *reference* text we have is:\n",
        "\n",
        "> The cat has fluffy hair.\n",
        "\n",
        "These two sentences look like paraphases but are not exact matches. Therefore these tasks require a more flexible evaluation in which we check for matching subsequences of $n$-grams. For this reason, we will take a close look to the popular BLEU score (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy).\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is BLEU?\n",
        "BLEU is a metric proposed by [Papineni et al (2002)](https://aclanthology.org/P02-1040.pdf) for automatic evaluation of machine translation. The BLEU score is number between 0 and 1 that compares the similarity of a predicted *candidate* text to a set of correct *reference* texts, where 1 means that the generated text is close to the reference and is of \"high quality\" and 0 is the opposite. BLEU was originally used for machine translation but can also be applied for any text generation task (ex: summarization). Note that often in practice the BLEU score is reported on a scale of 1 to 100 for granularity, but it's not an accuracy metric!\n",
        "\n",
        "So how do we calculate BLEU? In short, it has two terms:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **$n$-gram overlap calculation:** BLEU calculates the n-gram overlap counts of how many *candidate* unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and four-grams ($n$=1,...,4) match their $n$-gram counterpart in the *reference* sequence. **This can therefore be considered as a precision metric.** While unigrams might be capturing lexical level similarity, we can imagine that longer $n$-gram matching captures higher-level syntactic constituent similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **brevity penalty:** Since BLEU doesn't capture recall with the overlap calculation, we augment it with a brevity penalty. This penalizes generations that are too short compared to a reference length.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more details and an exact equation, checkout Google Cloud Translation's [evaluation documentation](https://cloud.google.com/translate/automl/docs/evaluate#:~:text=BLEU%20(BiLingual%20Evaluation%20Understudy)%20is,of%20high%20quality%20reference%20translations.).\n",
        "\n",
